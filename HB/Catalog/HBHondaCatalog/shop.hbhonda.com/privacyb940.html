Please see our <a target="terms" href="https://shop.hbhonda.com/terms.asp">Terms and Conditions</a> for additional information applicable to your use of our Website.
By accessing or using any areas of our Website, you expressly consent to the provisions of the Privacy Policy and to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of information obtained from you as described in this Privacy Policy.

<p style="text-align:center;">
<b>The Information We Collect</b>
</p>

<p>
You do not have to give us personally identifiable information in order to access and browse our Website.
However, while on our Website, you may be able to order and buy products, enter promotions, sweepstakes or other contests, participate in a survey, complete a questionnaire or other "information request" form, or otherwise communicate with us, including via email and/or SMS/text messaging.
In order to utilize, participate in or otherwise access such products, services or other offerings, you may be required to provide us with your personally identifiable information, which is information that, alone or in combination with other information, allows us to indentify you, such as your name, address, phone number, e mail address, contact preferences, credit card information, financial information or information relating to a support or service issue.
<br />
<b>If you provide us with your personally identifiable information, you are giving us permission to use that information for the specific purpose for which it is provided and for any other purpose described in this Privacy Policy, which are described in detail below under "How We Use the Information".</b>
Users unwilling to provide personally identifiable information online can choose not to provide such information, and in some (but not all) situations users may be able to work with a sales representative or customer service representative to utilize our services or other site offerings without providing personally identifiable information.
<b>IN ADDITION, IF YOU DO PROVIDE US WITH YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION, YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO PREVENT US FROM SHARING YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES IF YOU WISH, AS DESCRIBED BELOW UNDER "Your Options Regarding Personally Identifiable Information".</b>

All non-personally identifiable information we collect and all aggregated/compilations of data we create are our exclusive property.
